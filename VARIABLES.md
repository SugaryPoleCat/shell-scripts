### These are the variables you have to set in your `.profile` or `.bash_profile` thingy.

This is a list of variables you will have to set for these scripts to work. I also made a `variables.sh` file so you can easily copy and paste them in your profile thingy.

`LOG_FOLDER` = Where the logs should be located, something like `$HOME/LOGS` or something.

`SCRIPT_FOLDER` = Where did you clone this repo? Should end with `/shell-scripts`

`GIT_USER_NAME` = Your git username

`GIT_USER_EMAIL` = Your git email

`GIT_HUB` = The github link. Either use mine `git@github.com:SugaryPoleCat` or if you forked it, your own.

`PROGRAMMING_FOLDER` = Where all the Discord and website stuff you want to install will be located. If you don't have any discord bots or websites, uncomment this.

`DISCORD_FOLDER` = Where the Discord bots will be located.

`DISCORD_BOT_REPO` = What the Discord bot repository you want to clone and run is named. 

`WEBSITES_FOLDER` = Where the websites you want to host are located.

`SESSION_NAME_DISCORD` = What is the name of the session for `tmux` for your discord bot?
