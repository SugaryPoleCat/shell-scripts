# WHAT IS THIS

Well this repo is just a bunch of scripts that I use on my linux machines. 

All you have to do on your machine is install `git` however your linux system installs them. I use Debian so I use `sudo apt install git -y` (the -y is forcing YES).

Anyway if you are looking for a step by step here it is:
- Install git on your machine. For Debian, use: `sudo apt install git -y`.
- After installing git, go to your home (recommended, but optional) `cd ~`.
- Then clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:SugaryPoleCat/shell-scripts`
- When it's done, I recommend `cd shell-scripts/` and then running `sudo bash system-initialize.sh` to install all packages.

## There's a lot of stuff in the scripts that I don't use.

Well that's fine, you can delete it from the file or comment it out. Edit the files however you want to suit your needs. Whatever they may be.

As I'm running a website on my linux machines and a discord bot, that's what I clone and run, so I don't have to do it by hand. 

Hours of automation, for convenience. 

## Anyway...

I hope you find at least some of these scripts useful. If you have any imporvements, or changes you want to make....
